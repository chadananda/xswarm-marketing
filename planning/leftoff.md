  - package.json (4 occurrences)
  - bin/cli.js (6 occurrences)

## Key Design Decisions Made

### 1. Human-in-the-Loop is Critical
- **Decision:** AI suggests, user approves, always
- **Rationale:** Avoid ethical issues, not autonomous spamming
- **Implementation:** Every message requires user review/approval
- **Documentation:** Emphasized throughout README and FAQ

### 2. Name Selection: xswarm-buzz
- **Options considered:** blast, blitz, raid, storm, crush, amp, hype, buzz
- **Winner:** buzz
- **Why:**
  - Perfect thematic fit (bees buzz, swarms buzz)
  - Marketing term ("creating buzz")
  - Short (4 letters)
  - Fun and energetic
  - Not corporate or boring

### 3. Tone: Irreverent & Fun
- **Target:** Developer-marketers who want to do it all solo
- **Philosophy:** "Team of One" - ditch the marketing team
- **Style:** Anti-bureaucracy, pro-shipping, action-oriented
- **No:** Corporate speak, buzzwords, "synergy"

### 4. Multi-Model Architecture
- **Tier 1 (Complex):** Claude Sonnet, GPT-4, Gemini Pro - Strategy, creative
- **Tier 2 (Standard):** Claude Haiku, GPT-3.5, Gemini Flash, Llama 3.2
- **Tier 3 (Simple):** Local models (Llama, Phi) - FREE
- **Goal:** Use cheapest sufficient model for each task

### 5. Skills-Based Extensibility
- Core skills bundled with npm package
- Community skills fetchable from GitHub
- User can create custom skills
- Skills are model-invoked (Claude decides when to use)

## Next Immediate Steps

### Before Next Session
1. **Rename project folder** from `xswarm-marketing` to `xswarm-buzz`
   - This is why you're restarting
   - Update any IDE workspace references

### Phase 2: Implementation (Next Session)
According to PRD, we need to create **13 planning documents** before coding:

**Phase 1: Core UX**
1. First-Time User Experience - Installation to first message (30 min target)
2. Conversation Patterns - Natural language interaction, approval flows
3. Interface Design - Human mode vs machine mode (JSONL protocol)
4. Message Generation Deep Dive - Context → prompt → generation → learning

**Phase 2: Architecture**
5. Skill Interaction Model - Discovery, chaining, delegation, data flow
6. Subagent Orchestration - Model selection algorithm, cost optimization
7. Data Schemas & Storage - Complete data model with migrations
8. Authentication & Security Flows - OAuth per platform, token management

**Phase 3: Operations**
9. Campaign Lifecycle - Research → activation → execution → learning
10. Error Handling & Edge Cases - Detection, messages, recovery
11. Cost Modeling & Optimization - Per-tier costs, local vs cloud tradeoffs

**Phase 4: Community**
12. Skill Development Guide - Best practices, contribution process
13. Testing Strategy - Unit, integration, E2E for AI system

**Or:** Skip planning and start building core functionality if you prefer.

## Important Context for Resume

### User Preferences
- Wants cool ASCII art (but GitHub rendering is challenging - settled on logo image)
- Prefers conversational, fun tone over corporate
- Focused on "Team of One" philosophy
- Part of larger xSwarm ecosystem (xSwarm for planning/coding, xSwarm-Boss for system management)

### Technical Stack
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES modules)
- **CLI Framework:** Commander.js
- **UI Libraries:** Inquirer, Ora, Chalk
- **AI Integration:** Claude Code SDK (to be added in Phase 2)
- **Architecture:** Skills-based, multi-model, subagent orchestration

### Key Files to Reference
- `planning/prd.md` - Complete product specification
- `planning/skills-inventory.md` - Available Anthropic skills
- `README.md` - User-facing documentation (reflects aspirational state)
- `package.json` - Package configuration

### Open Questions / Decisions Needed
1. Should we create all 13 planning documents first, or dive into implementation?
2. Which core skills should we build first? (Suggestions: message-generator, daily-briefing)
3. Do we need to set up Claude Code SDK integration before building skills?
4. What's the priority: Local functionality first, or API integrations (LinkedIn, Gmail)?

## Commands to Resume Work

After renaming folder to `xswarm-buzz`:

```bash
cd "/Users/chad/Dropbox/Public/JS/Projects/NPM Modules/xswarm-buzz"

# Verify everything still works
npm install
node bin/cli.js --version
node bin/cli.js init  # Test in a temp directory

# Check git status
git status
git remote -v  # Should show xswarm-buzz

# Start development
npm run dev  # Watches for changes
```

## Session Summary

**What we shipped:**
- Complete README with Team of One philosophy ✅
- Full npm package structure ✅
- Skills inventory document ✅
- Complete rebrand to xswarm-buzz ✅
- GitHub repo renamed and reconnected ✅

**Current status:** Planning phase complete, infrastructure ready for Phase 2 implementation.

**Next session goal:** Decide whether to complete remaining planning documents OR start building core functionality (message generation, conversational interface, Claude Code SDK integration).

**Ready to create some buzz!** 🐝🚀
